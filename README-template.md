- Start a game and choose a category.
- Play Hangman with a random word selected from that category.
- See their current health decrease based on incorrect letter guesses.
- Win the game if they complete the whole word.
- Lose the game if they make eight wrong guesses.
- Pause the game and choose to continue, pick a new category, or quit.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)

### What I learned

Decided to use Solid.js for this project to learn more about it. It was a good experience and I will probably use it again in the future.

Also went and tried using SASS for styling, and modular CSS. Also interesting.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm ci
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
