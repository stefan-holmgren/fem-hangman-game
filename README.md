## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)

### What I learned

Decided to use Solid.js for this project to learn more about it. It was a good experience and I will probably use it again in the future.

Also went and tried using SASS for styling, and modular CSS. Also interesting.

The hardest part, which took me the longest, was to figure out how to have the secret text adapt to its confines. Was searching the web for all kinds of CSS only solutions, but totally failed in the end. So I decided to use a `scale-factor` css variable that shrank the text until they fit (according to javascript). The easiest way to see if the content fit its container was to check if `scrollHeight` was larger than `clientHeight` and if so, scale it down a bit. And then keep doing this until it fit. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm ci
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
